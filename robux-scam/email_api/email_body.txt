We would like to inform you that your child has unfortunately been the victim of our fake, educational scam website. Our website appears to offer free Robux (the currency of "Roblox") to entice users into entering sensitive information. While your child entered some information into our website, we did not save any information.

Our goal is to provide children with first-hand experience with scams without real-world repercussions. We encourage you to start a discussion with your child about online scams and internet safety.

Best Regards,
The Robux Scam Team
